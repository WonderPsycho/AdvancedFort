.. comment
    This is the development changelog file for DFHack.  If you add or change
    anything, note it here under the heading "DFHack Future", in the appropriate
    section. Items within each section are listed in alphabetical order to
    minimise merge conflicts.  Try to match the style and level of detail of the
    other entries.

    This file contains changes that are relevant to users of prereleases. These
    changes should include changes from just the previous release, whether that
    release was stable or not. For instance, a feature added in 0.43.05-alpha1
    should go under "0.43.05-alpha1" here *and* "0.43.05-r1" (or "future") in
    NEWS.rst. A fix in one prerelease for an issue in the previous prerelease
    should just go here in the appropriate section, not in NEWS.rst.

    Sections for each release are added as required, and consist solely of the
    following in order as subheadings::

        Fixes
        Structures
        API Changes
        Additions/Removals
        Other Changes

    When referring to a script, plugin, or command, use backticks (```) to
    create a link to the relevant documentation - and check that the docs are
    still up to date!

    When adding a new release, change "DFHack future" to the appropriate title
    before releasing, and then add a new "DFHack future" section after releasing.

  fixes `search-plugin`, `zone`, and `force`, among others.

  ``since`` attribute instead
