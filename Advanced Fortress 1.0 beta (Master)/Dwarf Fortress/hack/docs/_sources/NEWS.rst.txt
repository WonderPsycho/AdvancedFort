.. comment
    This is the changelog file for DFHack.  If you add or change anything, note
    it here under the heading "DFHack Future", in the appropriate section.
    Items within each section are listed in alphabetical order to minimise merge
    conflicts.  Try to match the style and level of detail of the other entries.

    This file should not contain details specific to prereleases, but it should
    contain changes from previous stable releases. For example, if a bug was
    introduced in one alpha version and fixed in another, do not include it
    here.

    Sections for each release are added as required, and consist solely of the
    following in order as subheadings::

        New [Internal Commands | Plugins | Scripts | Tweaks | Features]
        Fixes
        Misc Improvements
        Removed
        Internals
        Lua
        Ruby

    When referring to a script, plugin, or command, use backticks (```) to
    create a link to the relevant documentation - and check that the docs are
    still up to date!

    When adding a new release, change "DFHack future" to the appropriate title
    before releasing, and then add a new "DFHack future" section after releasing.
