Well, here you are. I don't know if you knew what the Ekklos were already and looked for answers after your suspicion was piqued, or stumbled on this secret by accident. But this is indeed the truth. The Ekklos can reproduce. While they have the appearance of the undead, the idea that they are the result of necromantic magic is not quite the truth. In actuality, the disaster that afflicted the long-forgotten home city of the human Ekklos turned them into a kind of elemental earth spirit, possessing their own calcified corpses. This new breed of life can reproduce by harvesting minerals found in the human skeleton, and shaping them into a sphere covered in runes designed to evoke the power of earth. This sphere is carried within the ribcage of an Ekklos possessed by a female spirit. After some time, the harvested minerals will form the shape and structure of organic bone, and a new mind will be birthed into the body. The great secret of the Ekklos is that they are not dying at all, but thriving. Their myopia and despair they desplay is genuine, however, for what they have lost in the great cataclysm will likely never be regained, but they will still persist, carrying on their search for knowledge, knowing that when they are inevitably struck down, another will rise to take their place. But perhaps, just maybe, they will survive long enough to see the birth of a new great empire. And when that day comes, the long exile of the Ekklos shall finally end.
